<p>Shih Tzus need to be groomed regularly, but this schedule will vary depending on the individual dog's coat and personal grooming needs. Shih Tzus should be groomed at least once every two weeks, but more frequent grooming can be necessary if their coat is difficult to manage or they are constantly shedding.
